# Unit Testing Example in JavaScript

This uses the ECMAScript module system for the code under test. Mocha is used
as the test framework.

## Requirements

Install Node.js version greater than 13.2.0. Then run `npm install` to install packages.

## Run the test cases

To run the test cases, run `npm run test`.

## Run the web application

Run `npm run serve`, and visit the http://localhost:5000 (or the URL in the output). Note that
if you open index.html file in the browser by itself, you will get the CORS error.
